### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, was one of my favorite labs because I got to learn the basics of getting started with using Linux and the possibilities of coding that I would do for the next 14 weeks of being in a computer science class. I learned to install Linux on my laptop to code in future labs.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was also another favorite lab because this is the lab where I got to use vectors and the way that the can make code easier while making a list. After this lab, the vector has become a crucial part into coding in the C++ software to make code.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was my final favorite lab. The reason why is because this lab to me personally was one of the hard ones because we had to combine vectors to state the card names in the output as well as counting the cards. I was also curious on how to play blackjack and this code made me understand it.
